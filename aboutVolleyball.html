        <ul>
            <li>Each team must send the ball regularly over the net to ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded on their own court.</li>
            <li>The ball is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the opponent's court. </li>
            <li>A team is allowed to hit the ball three times (in addition to the block contact) to return it to the opponent's court.</li>
            <li>A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block.</li>
            <li>The rally continues until the ball touches the court, goes out of bounds, a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault. </li>
        </ul>

        The winning team of a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.
        The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).
